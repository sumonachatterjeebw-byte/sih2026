Ice resistance and powering: Lindqvist (1989) plus an open-water baseline.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
Everything downstream of the route optimiser needs one number the optimiser is not allowed
to assume: how fast this hull can actually go, here, in this ice. Speed has to be an *output*
of the physics, because if it is an input then the fuel figure, the emissions figure and the
"savings" figure are all assertions rather than results (build spec P1). So this file computes
resistance, converts resistance into required power, and then inverts the balance to get
attainable speed.

WHAT IS MODELLED
----------------
    R_total(v, h, C) = R_open_water(v) + C^n * R_ice(v, h)

`R_ice` is Lindqvist's three-component level-ice method: crushing at the stem, bending the
sheet into cusps, and submerging and sliding the broken floes aft. Lindqvist is a level-ice
method, valid at 10/10 concentration, so a broken field is handled by scaling with
concentration raised to `ICE_CONCENTRATION_EXPONENT`. `R_open_water` is an ITTC-1957 friction
line over a Denny-Mumford wetted surface plus a residuary term, and it is what keeps total
resistance continuous as the ice thins to nothing. The v0.1 model jumped discontinuously
between an ice branch and a hard-coded 10 kN floor.

CHANGES MADE TO THE v0.1 FORMULATION, AND WHY
---------------------------------------------
The v0.1 file carried a garbled transcription of Lindqvist. Every term was checked against
the published form (Lindqvist, POAC'89, as reproduced in Fan T. et al., "Estimation of ice
resistance and sensitivity analysis for an icebreaker", Advances in Polar Science 30(4), 2019,
equations 1 to 4) and four errors were corrected.

1.  Crushing. v0.1 computed `0.5 sigma_b h^2 (tan(phi) + mu cos(phi)/sin(alpha)) / cos(alpha)`.
    The friction term is divided by `cos(psi)`, not `sin(alpha)`, and the whole expression is
    divided by `(1 - mu sin(phi)/cos(psi))`, a denominator v0.1 dropped entirely. That
    denominator is what makes a high-friction hull disproportionately expensive, which is
    precisely the effect an ice-navigation tool must not lose.

2.  Bending. v0.1 computed `0.003 E h^1.5 B tan(psi)/cos(phi)`. Two problems. It is
    dimensionally inconsistent, giving Pa m^2.5 rather than newtons, and it puts Young's
    modulus in the numerator, so a stiffer ice sheet comes out *harder* to break. Physically
    the opposite holds: a stiffer plate has a longer characteristic length on its elastic
    foundation, so the cusp that breaks off is larger and fails at a lower load for the same
    flexural strength. Lindqvist drives the term with flexural strength and divides by
    `sqrt(E / (12 (1 - nu^2) rho_w g))`, which is that length scale. Restored.

3.  Submergence. v0.1 used the shorthand `(1 + 2 mu L/B)` for the friction of floes sliding
    aft along the hull. Lindqvist writes that friction out over the actual wetted geometry,
    `0.7 L - T/tan(phi) - B/(4 tan(alpha)) + T cos(phi) cos(psi) sqrt(...)`, which is what
    makes the term respond to hull form at all. Restored.

4.  Velocity correction. v0.1 applied a single `(1 + 0.4 v / sqrt(g h))` to all three terms.
    Lindqvist applies `(1 + 1.4 v / sqrt(g h))` to crushing and bending and a much stronger
    `(1 + 9.4 v / sqrt(g L))` to submergence, because submergence is dominated by accelerating
    and clearing broken ice along the hull, a ship-scale rather than an ice-scale process.
    Using one factor for both gets the speed sensitivity of a long ship in thin ice badly
    wrong. Restored.

Two smaller corrections. The flare angle is not an independent input: Lindqvist fixes it by
`psi = arctan(tan(phi) / sin(alpha))`, so `VesselParameters.flare_angle_deg` is now carried
for reporting only and the formula uses the derived value (the presets store the derived value
so the two agree). And the inline densities 1025/917 were replaced by the project constants
1027/920.

One honest caveat on a coefficient. The leading constant on the bending term appears in the
literature both as 37/64 and as 27/64. We use 37/64, which is the value in the reference above
and the value that reproduces its published results.

VALIDATION
----------
Against Fan et al. (2019) Table 3, a 118 m x 21.5 m x 7.5 m icebreaker in 500.8 kPa ice, this
implementation reproduces their published Lindqvist column to within 1.5 to 3.4 percent at
1.6 m thickness and 10.5 percent at 0.95 m. Most of the residual comes from ice density: they
used 900 kg/m3 where the project constant is 920, which moves the submergence term by about
nine percent. That is inside the scatter of the method itself, quoted at roughly 13 percent
mean error against model tests. `tests/test_lindqvist_extended.py` pins this comparison so a
coefficient cannot drift unnoticed.

One further note on Young's modulus, because it changes the answer. The project constant is
2 GPa, an effective (static) modulus; Lindqvist's own calibration and most of the literature
use the dynamic modulus, 5 to 9 GPa. Since the bending term divides by sqrt(E), 2 GPa makes it
roughly twice as large. The model is therefore conservative on the default: it will under-
promise speed rather than over-promise it. We keep the project constant rather than tune it to
a friendlier answer, and the modulus stays a caller-supplied argument so this can be revisited
with a stated reason.

POWERING, AND WHY THERE ARE TWO SPEED LIMITS
--------------------------------------------
Required power is `R_total * v / eta_D`. That is the classical relation and it is what the API
reports, but on its own it over-predicts attainable speed in heavy ice, because it assumes the
propeller can deliver whatever thrust is asked of it. It cannot: as the ship slows the
propeller approaches bollard conditions and open-water efficiency collapses. So
`attainable_speed` binds two limits and takes the lower:

  * a power limit, `R_total(v) v / eta_D = P_available`, solved by bisection, and
  * a thrust limit, `C^n R_ice(v) = T_net(v)`, using the Finnish-Swedish Ice Class Rules net
    thrust relation `T = Ke (P_D D)^(2/3)` with the rules' speed decay
    `1 - (1/3)(v/v_ow) - (2/3)(v/v_ow)^2`. `T_net` is already net of open-water resistance,
    which is why it is balanced against the ice term alone.

If the net bollard thrust cannot push the ship through the ice fast enough to hold steerage
way, it cannot make way at all. That is besetting: `attainable_speed` returns 0.0 and
`ResistanceResult.is_beset` is set. It is a real operational state and the model has to be
able to say so, rather than always returning some small positive speed that would let a
planner route straight through a ridge field.

Propeller-ice interaction degrades both the quasi-propulsive coefficient and the delivered
thrust. Milling, blockage of the propeller inflow by broken floes, and ventilation cost a real
ship up to about a quarter of its open-water QPC in thick, close ice; one severity factor,
scaled by thickness and concentration, is applied to both.
